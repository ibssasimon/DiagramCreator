Assignment 7 for CS106A. This program allows for the user to input text (up to 10 characters), and converts that text into a textBox that appears on a canvas. These boxes are able to be moved if they are dragged. Controls include: adding a textBox, removing a textBox by input, and clearing the canvas. Best wishes, Simon :)
